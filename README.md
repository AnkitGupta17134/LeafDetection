# LeafDetection
Defected Leaf Detection

The project is about plant leaf disease detection using Image Processing techniques. Due to various
climatic conditions and the use of chemical plants get diseased. Leaves of diseased plants become
unhealthy because of the formation of various types of infection in the form of degraded leaves. The
usage of diseased plants causes a harmful effect on health. There are always a whole bunch of leaves to be
checked which is inefficient for an individual to do and it is impossible to inspect with naked eyes
whether the plant is diseased or not, image processing is done to solve this problem. So, in this project, we
tried to resolve this problem using a videocam and Image analysis techniques.

Proposed methodology
1. Image pre-processing- Histogram Equalisation, Image clipping, Noise Removal.
2. Image segmentation - Edge Detection, Spot detection.
3. Feature extraction - Clustering.
4. Classification - SVM
5. Accuracy
